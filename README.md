The TMDB API (https://api.themoviedb.org) was used for the App.

The App was built with React components only, with a unique and great design in CSS, in addition to this it is fully responsive.

There are 3 sections in the App (movie-Tv-person) each of them contains a main component that will choose a different element from each one, that is, a movie, a TV series or a random person that will be shown in said component, will also have a list of elements which contain a pagination every 8 elements, the navigation through said sections is generated from React-Router-Dom to avoid total rendering of the page when changing between said sections, it also contains a header which contains a search element that will display any movie, TV series or person searched for and found in the TMDB database.
